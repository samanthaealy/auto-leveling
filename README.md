# auto-leveling

Created by Samantha Ealy and Dominique Brych

Final Project for 24-441 Engineering Design II at Carnegie Mellon University.

Arduino code to auto-level the playfield of a pinball machine. This allows the player to adjust the difficulty level of the game. We attached an IMU to the bottom of the playfield to read the angle and make the appropriate adjustments.
